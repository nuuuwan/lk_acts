Items 1 to 4 of this Schedule shall not apply where - (a) the controller has established the fact that the data subject has already been provided with or made aware of the information; or (b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archival purposes in the public interest in the manner provided for by any written law, scientific research, historical research or statistical research purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards provided in this Act or in so far as the obligation referred to in item 1 of this Schedule is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms of data subject protected under any written law, including making the relevant information publicly available; or (c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by any written law to which the controller is subjected to and which provides appropriate measures to protect the rights and freedoms of data subjects protected under this Act and such written law; or (d) the personal data shall remain confidential, consequent to obligations of professional privilege or is not permitted to be disclosed under any written law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.
